Sprint Goals: Implement the Login, Register, and a minor amount of the settings features.

Sprint Outcomes: Implemented the Login and Register functions, but it needs to have security functionality and encryption for the passwords and accounts in general. The settings have been created, but need altered once we get further into it beyond just Full Name, Degree, and Address. Once we know more of what the accounts can hold we can do that. Also, the settings can be edited and saved.

Team Members: Yiyou Pan, Nikolas Z., Cole Colkin, Will Epperly

How to run: RUNNING ON PORT 8081, this is because when setting up Will was running another project on 8080 for his work. Pull the code, start running the cshub database, run the frontend and backend with npm and gradle respectively, and once it's booted up you should be taken to the login page where you can register an account, login after, and alter details in the settings.
